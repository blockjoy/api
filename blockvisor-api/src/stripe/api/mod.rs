//! Types reimplemented from <https://crates.io/crates/cloudflare>.
//! Note that several of the fields in the api definitions are commented out. We do this because
//! they often contain nested definition's that we do not use, and we don't want to pay the
//! maintenance / binary size / compilation time cost of having them commented in. If you do need a
//! field that is commented out, feel free to comment it in.

//! This module contains the code related to database tables. Each table is represented by one or
//! more models, which are structs that have a field for the columns of the queries that they
//! interact with. There may exist multiple models for a given table, for example models that are
//! used for updating rows often do not contain all of the columns, whereas models that are used
//! for selecting usually do.
//!
//! ### Database Connection Type
//! We want our endpoints to be atomic, meaning that if an api call succeeds, it will succeed in
//! its entirety. When it fails, it must not have modified the state of the database. To this end
//! we distinguish between two different types of function that interact with the database. Those
//! that mutate, i.e. perform queries using INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE, and those that do not, i.e.
//! those that only do SELECT. To ensure atomicity, the functions that mutate _must_ be called from
//! within a transaction. There is no easy way to ensure that this happens automatically, but we
//! can at least keep the responsibility of verifying this contained to this module. The way we
//! enforce this is by having the functions that mutate accept a database connection of a different
//! type than those that do  not mutate. Functions that mutate state will accept their database
//! connection argument as  `tx: &mut super::DbTrx<'_>`, whereas functions that do not mutate take
//! `db: impl sqlx::PgExecutor<'_>` as their database connection. This ensures that mutating
//! functions _must_ happen from within a transaction, and functions that not mutate may either be\
//! called from a transaction or from a 'bare' connection.
